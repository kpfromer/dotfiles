## Built With

I am using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to handle installing dot files. [Here is a great article
about using stow](https://codys.club/blog/2015/07/07/managing-your-dotfiles-with-gnu-stow/).

For example to install all try:

```bash
stow -vt ~ bash bspwm dunst git picom spicetify sxhkd vim zsh
```
