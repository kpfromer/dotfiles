# rofi

This rofi config was based off of a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/8lltp4/i3gapsi3_with_polybar_rofi_conky_and_compton/) using his [rofi dotfiles](https://github.com/bresilla/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/rofi).

Please note that for rofi_full.rasi to work .Xresources needs to have `rofi.fullscreen:true`
